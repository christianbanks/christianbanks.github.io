            <p>Peter Gene Hernandez, known professionally as Bruno Mars, was born on October 8, 1985.
                Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Hernandez moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. After being dropped by Motown Records, Mars signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009.
                In the same year, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. 
                Mars rose to fame in 2010 with the release of the successful singles "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals on the hooks.</p>
            <p>Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Hernandez signed with Motown Records in 2004, in a deal that "went nowhere", and had a conversation with Will.i.am's management which turned out to be fruitless.
               During this time, people in the music industry took Hernandez as another Latino artist, due to his surname, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [Iglesias] is so hot right now”. 
               Nevertheless, Hernandez used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to "avoid being stereotyped". However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career when he met songwriter and producer Philip Lawrence, who was also signed to the label</p>
