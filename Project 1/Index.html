                <p>Hello, I am an aspiring artist who is looking to pursue a career in graphic arts. My hobbies are sketching, browsing the internet, and playing video games. 
                I am very passionate about art and love experimenting with different forms of art, such as painting and printmaking. I am always looking to improve and take inspiration from others.</p>
                <p> I was born in November 27, 1996 and was raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2015, I placed 10th place in Loisiana's George Rodrigues Art Contest with my drawing, "The Bayou Jazz".
